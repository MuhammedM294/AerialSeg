# AerialSeg: Semantic Segmentation of Road Networks using PyTorch and U-Net Architecture
This repository provides an implementation of semantic segmentation for road networks using PyTorch and the U-Net architecture. It focuses specifically on processing aerial images from the Massachusetts dataset.

## Dataset

The Massachusetts dataset consists of aerial images captured from various locations in Massachusetts, USA. It includes high-resolution images labeled with pixel-level annotations for road networks.

To use this codebase, you need to obtain the Massachusetts dataset separately. You can find the dataset and its corresponding annotations on this [link](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/).
